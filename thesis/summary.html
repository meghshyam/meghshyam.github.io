  <h2>Mosaicing Scenes With Vacant Spaces </h2>
</div>
One of the major contribution of this piece of the thesis is a method to create a mosaic of a scene containing vacant spaces using fusion
of a standard stiching algorithm with positional data captured from a quadcotper.
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<center>
<img width=600 src=images/vacantSpacesChallenge.png>
</center>
<ul>

<li> The standard mosaicing methods use feature matching algorithms for
  estimating the homography between two images.</li>

<li> Feature matching algorithms require detection of sufficient features in both images for mosaicing.</li>

<li> Standard stitchers cannot stitch images which have none or very little features in common.</li>

<li> Scenes containing large regions with vacant spaces result in very few (or almost zero) features.</li>

<li>Vacant spaces pose a problem for stitching images.</li>

<li>The feature matching algorithms get confused when parts of the scene are repeated.</li>

<li> Popular mosaicing softwares are unable to handle vacant spaces and repetitive patterns.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Contributions</h3>
<ul>
<li> We propose to solve the vacant space problem by using additional positional information avail-
able from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) onboard an inexpensive quadcopter.</li>

<li> We use IMU data for selection and ordering of images and creation of super-panorama. </li>

<li> We use the IMU data to select representative images from the video and arrange
  them into rectangular grid according to the `spatial' neighborhood. It also
  disambiguates situations when multiple images that are spatially distant,
  have similar, repeated features.</li>

<li> Whenever there are no features in the overlap region of two images, we use the IMU data to find the
  relative position of one mini-panorama with respect to another.</li>

<li>IMU data on a quadcopter cannot be relied exclusively, especially due to swift and jerky movements
    of an inexpensive devices which may result in erroneous data. Complementing the IMU with information gleaned from
    vision algorithms, however, may be a useful practice.</li>

<li> We systematically acquire a video of the scene, reduce the input video to a manageable number of images,
     and finally, combine the images acquired from different positions into a mosaic.</li>
</ul>

 <h2> Imaging Multiplanar Scenes </h2>
</div>
We have many circumstances where the input scene is spread over multiple planes.
In such cases, we would like to image each planar region orthographically and then 'unroll'
the whole scene by joining the individual mosaics so that we get the output mosaic of the
input scene as if it is present on a single plane.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Homography-based mosaicing algorithms cannot mosaic scenes spread over multiplanar surface.</li>

<li> Manually controlling a quadcopter to image large planar regions smoothly by
keeping a constant distance from the imaging plane is very difficult.</li>

<li> A quadcopter has to be maneuvered along an estimated path such that it will cover
the input scene in minimum time.</li>

<li> We require accurate 3D coordinates of the region to be imaged on the fly for doing efficient path planning.</li>

<li>Existing method like PTAM creates a 3D map for camera-based navigation of a quadcopter. However, it is not 
sufficiently precise for our purposes due to inaccuracies in scale.</li>

<li> Multiplanar imaging through quadcopter requires detection of multiplanar bounded regions
in real-time.</li>

<li>Existing method like J-linkage do not output the boundaries of planar regions as well as remove noisy points.</li>
</ul>

</center>

<h3>Contributions</h3>
<ul>
<li> We probe the input scene through a quadcopter, calculate the 3D positions of feature
points using PTAM based method.</li>

<li> We use our algorithm, an improvement over J-linkage [8] to detect multiplanar bounded regions from the area 
marked by the user through our user interface.</li>

<li> Path planning is done for each planar bounded region to determine the camera positions in such a way that 
images captured from those positions encompass the scene in an optimal manner.</li>

<li>The quadcopter is autonomously maneuvered along the estimated path and videos are captured at target points. </li>

<li>For each planar bounded region, the appropriate frame from each video is found and then given to a mosaicing algorithm. </li>

<li>All individual mosaics are joined to get a full unrolled view as if the whole scene is present on a single plane.</li>
</ul>

 <h2> Detecting Fiducials Under Blur</h2>
</div>
A single quadcopter is not sufficient for imaging large multiplanar scenes due to energy
constraints. Instead, we may use multiple quadcopters in collaboration for imaging mul-
tiplanar scenes. In such cases, we have to identify each quadcopter uniquely for accurate
collaboration among multiple quadcopters.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jerky and swift movements of quadcopter introduces motion blur challenging tracking of quadcopter.</li>
<li>Most existing fiducials such as ARTag are not designed to handle motion blur.</li>
<li>There may be large discontinuities in the pattern’s position due to missing video frames from the
quadcopter’s wireless communication module. </li>
<li>Missing video frames make it challenging to apply tracking algorithms that can
exploit temporal coherence for determining the fiducial’s position.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contributions</h3>
<ul>
<li>We propose a fiducial that is designed to be resilient to motion blur.</li>
<li>When our fiducial is blurred, there is no blur in the direction perpendicular to
the direction of motion.</li>
<li>We apply a Gabor filter on the image to isolate the potential
locations of the pattern.</li>
<li>We find clusters of patches in the Gabor output.</li>
<li>We perform the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on each cluster to find
the dominant direction unaffected by the blur.</li>
<li>Based on the direction detected, we extract the intensity profile of the pattern and classify the fiducial.</li>
</ul>
