 <h2> Imaging Multiplanar Scenes </h2>
</div>

We have many circumstances where the input scene is spread over multiple planes.
In such cases, we would like to image each planar region orthographically and then 'unroll'
the whole scene by joining the individual mosaics so that we get the output mosaic of the
input scene as if it is present on a single plane.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Homography-based mosaicing algorithms cannot mosaic scenes spread over multiplanar surface.</li>

<li> Manually controlling a quadcopter to image large planar regions smoothly by
keeping a constant distance from the imaging plane is very difficult.</li>

<li> A quadcopter has to be maneuvered along an estimated path such that it will cover
the input scene in minimum time.</li>

<li> We require accurate 3D coordinates of the region to be imaged on the fly for doing efficient path planning.</li>

<li>Existing method like PTAM creates a 3D map for camera-based navigation of a quadcopter. However, it is not 
sufficiently precise for our purposes due to inaccuracies in scale.</li>

<li> Multiplanar imaging through quadcopter requires detection of multiplanar bounded regions
in real-time.</li>
<ul>
<li>Existing methods such as J-linkage do not output the boundaries of planar regions.  Also, these methods cannot remove noisy points generated by erroneous PTAM as shown in Figure 4.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contributions</h3>
<ul>
<li> We probe the input scene through a quadcopter, calculate the 3D positions of feature
points using PTAM based method.</li>

<li> We use our algorithm, an improvement over J-linkage to detect multiplanar bounded regions from the area 
marked by the user through our user interface.</li>

<li> Path planning is done for each planar bounded region to determine the camera positions in such a way that 
images captured from those positions encompass the scene in an optimal manner.</li>

<li>The quadcopter is autonomously maneuvered along the estimated path and videos are captured at target points. </li>

<li>For each planar bounded region, the appropriate frame from each video is found and then given to a mosaicing algorithm. </li>

<li>All individual mosaics are joined to get a full unrolled view as if the whole scene is present on a single plane.</li>
</ul>

We probe the input scene through a quadcopter, calculate the 3D positions of feature points using PTAM
based method. Later, we use our algorithm, an improvement over
J-linkage to detect multiplanar bounded regions from the area
marked by the user through our user interface. Path planning is done for each
planar bounded region to determine the camera positions in such a way that
images captured from those positions encompass the scene in an optimal manner.
The quadcopter is autonomously maneuvered along the estimated path and videos
are captured at target points. For each planar bounded region, the appropriate
frame from each video is found and then given to a mosaicing algorithm. 
Finally, all mosaics are joined to get a full unrolled view.
