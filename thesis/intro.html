  <h2>Abstract</h2>
Digital imaging is being extensively used in in today's world. That said, it is quite difficult to take acceptable pictures 
from a handheld
camera in several situations, such as in the inspection of large scale structures 
 including nuclear reactors and dams. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadcopter> Quadcopters </a>can be used to 
  image large surfaces and from a close distance, thereby permitting detail. As a consequence of the the 
  proximity, we end up with a reduced field of view, and 
  thus there is a need to create a panoramic representation from photos or videos taken from a flying craft.  
  What (interesting) photos should we take, and from where to take them, is a technical question that we address in this work.
<p>
<div id="vacantspaces">
Further, if there are regions in the scene with few or no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeded_up_robust_features">
features </a> (e.g., gaps between regions, or even textureless regions) it is not possible for existing mosaicing techniques to
construct a panorama. Lack of features, 
  a situation we term <a href="vacant.html#vacantspaces"><font color=blue >vacant spaces </font></a>, 
  confound the matching algorithm used to stitch interesting images. 
  Likewise, if <a href="vacant.html#repetitivePatterns"> <font color=blue >patterns repeat in a scene</font></a>, 
  the mosaicing algorithm  gets confounded, resulting in incorrect mosaicing. 
  <i> 
  We argue that the panoramic mosaicing problem is unsolved, and we present solutions </i> 
  using  additional kinematic information present in the 
  Inertial Measurement Unit (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit">IMU</a>) of 
  even the most inexpensive quadcopter.

<div id="unrolled">
With these ideas, we could build an image mosaic of very large planar surfaces. In the real world, we expect to  encounter multiple
piecewise planar surfaces, or even curved surfaces. Manually navigating the quadcopter around such large surfaces for the purpose
of capturing a <i> orthographic </i> video footage is tedious. We present a method for  navigation of a quadcopter for imaging
large multiplanar surfaces. The method 
 <!-- uses the Parallel Tracking and Mapping (<a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gk/PTAM/">PTAM</a>) 
 approach to -->
 finds the <i> path along which the quadcopter is autonomously maneuvered. </i> 
  The eventual result is an <a href="summary.html#multiplanar"><font color=blue >unrolled</font></a> view of the input scene 
  where we get the output mosaic of
the input scene as if it were present on a single plane.

<div id="fiducial">
A quadcopter's limited battery is a hurdle we experienced during
the imaging of large multiplanar scenes.  We hypothesized the use of
multiple quadcopters simultaneously to overcome this  draining issue. 
  To collaborate, the relative spatial position of the
quadcopters have to be identified, so as to divide the  work in an appropriate manner. 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_marker">Fiducials</a> are necessary for identifying objects, 
  but in our environment, the quadcopters are subject to quick and unstable motions. 
  This causes significant motion blur in the captured images and this severely affects the
 identification of the quadcopters using existing fiducials.  
  We design fiducials that is resilient to motion blur with the intention of placing these on quadcopters.
