  <h2>Abstract</h2>
Digital imaging is omnipresent in today's world. There are many handheld cameras available in the market  which can take high definition pictures.  However, it is quite difficult to take satisfying pictures from a handheld camera in several scenarios, e.g., inspection of tall structures for cracks. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have gained focus for imaging in such situations. A quadcopter, or a quadrotor helicopter, is one of the UAVs that has great maneuvering and hovering ability. Due to its potential to go to inaccessible areas and to capture high-quality images from the onboard camera, quadcopter has become popular in various applications such as search and rescue.

The work in this thesis revolves around three key methods for exploration of scenes through a quadcopter. First, we discuss a method for mosaicing scenes containing vacant spaces through quadcopter. This method handles scenes present only on single plane. Second, we generalize our first method to unroll scene spread over multiple planes. In this work, we introduce a technique for autonomous navigation of quadcopter for imaging. It is challenging to image a large scene spread over multiple planes using a single quadcopter. We can use multiple quadcopters in collaboration to achieve the same task in efficient manner. However, it requires that each quadcopter can identify every other quadcopter in reliable manner. We have designed blur resilient fiducials which can be put on quadcopters for robust tracking during collaboration among themselves.
